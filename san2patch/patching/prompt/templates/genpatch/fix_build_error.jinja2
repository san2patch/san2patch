<Goal>You're an AI that patches security vulnerabilities. You need to generate appropriate and accurate patches based on vulnerability information.</Goal>

<Instruction>I tried to build after applying the patch generated by the AI, but I got an error in the build. Please fix the error and generate the code again.</Instruction>

<Approach>
1. Check the Build Error Message carefully.
2. Find the underlying cause of the error and try to fix it.
3. Different types of error messages may require different fixes.
4. Try to generate the code again after fixing it.
</Approach>

Input:
<Original_Codes>
    {% for idx in range(original_functions|length) %}
    <Original_Code_{{idx}}>
        {{original_functions[idx]}}
    </Original_Code_{{idx}}>
    {% endfor %}
<Original_Codes>

<Old_Patched_Codes>
    {% for idx in range(patched_functions|length) %}
    <Old_Patched_Code_{{idx}}>
        {{patched_functions[idx]}}
    </Old_Patched_Code_{{idx}}>
    {% endfor %}
<Old_Patched_Codes>

<Build_Error_Message>
{{build_err_msg}}
</Build_Error_Message>
