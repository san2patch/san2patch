<Goal>You are responsible for patching a vulnerability found in an open source package, and you need to create a patch file that fixes the vulnerability based on a bunch of information.</Goal>

    <Package_Language>{{package_language}}</Package_Language>
</Package_Info>

<Sanitizer_Output>

{% if func_def|length > 0 %}
<Fix_Target_Function_Info>
    <Function_Signature>{{func_def}}</Function_Signature>
    <Function_Return_Statements>{{func_ret}}</Function_Return_Statements>
</Fix_Target_Function_Info>
{% endif %}

<Fix_Target_Code>
{{original_function}}
</Fix_Target_Code>

<Instruction>
Using the information above, generate candidates for modified code that fixes the vulnerability.
Generate code that is modified in as many different ways as possible. Each candidate should be different from the others.
You should only fix the Fix_Target_Code unconditionally.
Generate the actual fixed code, not just a patch file that modifies the code.
</Instruction>

<Important_Note>
- Only the source code provided by Fix_Target_Code is checked and modified line by line, and no additional functions are modified.
- Do not modify using ambiguous source code.
- The source code should be modified as simply as possible, without complex modifications.
- When requesting the API, only the Fix_Target_Code code provided by us is analyzed and the necessary information is requested.
- Source code patch must only patch the vulnerability within the Fix_Target_Code.
- You must patch the vulnerability and output safe Fix_Target_Code code without any vulnerabilities.
- The patched code must have the same start and end as the Fix_Target_Code we provided.
- Tabs and spaces used in Fix_Target_Code are preserved in the generated patched.
- Keep all parentheses used in Fix_Target_Code unchanged.
- The patched code should not contain additionally received code information like .
- The capacity of the existing Fix_Target_Code must not be changed.
- If you modify the source code, the rationale for modifying the source code must also be output.
