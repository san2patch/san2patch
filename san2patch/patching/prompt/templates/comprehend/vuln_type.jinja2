Next, identify the type of vulnerability.
Based on the root cause of the vulnerability you identified earlier, identify the type of vulnerability in the form of a CWE.

When determining the type of vulnerability, use the most specific CWE possible.
For example, use more specific CWEs such as CWE-125: Out-of-bounds read, CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write, etc. instead of CWE-119: Buffer Overflow.
